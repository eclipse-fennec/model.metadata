/**
 * Computes a canonical, content-derived fingerprint of a model version.
 * <p>
 * The fingerprint keys derived artifacts (aspects/profiles) so they can be stored
 * once, reused on re-registration, and replicated across systems. It has three
 * guaranteed properties:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Reproducible</b> — the same {@link EPackage} content plus the same
 *       derivation inputs yields the same value on every node, without coordination
 *       and independent of object identity, {@code hashCode}, registration order,
 *       serialization order/whitespace or wall-clock time.</li>
 *   <li><b>Identifying</b> — structurally different content (added/removed/renamed
 *       classifiers, features, operations; changed types; changed log-relevant
 *       annotations) yields a different value; the nsURI alone is never the key.</li>
 *   <li><b>Canonical</b> — semantically irrelevant differences (e.g. the order in
 *       which classifiers appear in the package, or GenModel {@code documentation}
 *       annotations) do not affect the value.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Schemes</h2>
 * A value is {@code <scheme>:<digest>}, e.g. {@code fp1:9f86d0…}. The scheme tag versions
 * the <em>canonicalization algorithm</em>, not the model — two values with different tags
 * are not comparable, even for the same model. An implementation may keep several schemes
 * computable at the same time so that a scheme bump does not invalidate what is already
 * computable: {@link #currentScheme()} names the one used for new values,
 * {@link #supportedSchemes()} lists all of them, and
 * {@link #fingerprintInScheme(String, EPackage, String...)} addresses one explicitly.
 * <p>
 * Consumers that merely resolve a value they read elsewhere need none of this — they pass
 * it to {@code MetadataService.getPackageMetadataByFingerprint} and react to the result.
