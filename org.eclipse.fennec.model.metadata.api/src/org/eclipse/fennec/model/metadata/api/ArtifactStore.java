/**
 * Durable storage for derived artifacts (aspects/profiles), keyed by the fingerprint
 * of the model version they were derived from (see {@link FingerprintService}) plus an
 * artifact type id.
 * <p>
 * This is the storage-delegate the metadata service uses to persist a derived artifact
 * once and resolve it again on package re-registration, instead of rebuilding it. An
 * in-memory implementation is the default; a Model-Atlas-backed implementation stores
 * the artifacts in an EObject registry.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are <b>copy-isolating</b>: {@link #put} stores an independent copy and
 * {@link #resolve} returns an independent copy, so mutating an artifact handed to or
 * returned from the store never corrupts the stored state.
